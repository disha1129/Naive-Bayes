# Naive-Bayes
Naïve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.


Naïve: It is called Naïve because it assumes that the occurrence of a certain feature is independent of the occurrence of other features. Such as if the fruit is identified on the bases of color, shape, and taste, then red, spherical, and sweet fruit is recognized as an apple. Hence each feature individually contributes to identify that it is an apple without depending on each other.

Bayes: It is called Bayes because it depends on the principle of Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' theorem is also known as Bayes' Rule or Bayes' law, which is used to determine the probability of a hypothesis with prior knowledge. It depends on the conditional probability.
                                 P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} 


### Types
Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier: used when features are not discreet.

Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier: used when features follow a multinomial distribution.

Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier: used when features are of the boolean type.
